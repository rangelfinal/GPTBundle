# GPTBundle Documentation

## What is GPTBundle?
GPTBundle, a React application toolkit, harnesses AI to convert textual content into structured forms and delivers advanced autofill suggestions. 
Leveraging GPT-4 from OpenAI's API simplifies form development, accelerating the process and enhancing intuitiveness.

## Getting Started
### Installation

```bash
npm install @ai-form-toolkit/client @ai-form-toolkit/server
```

### Configuration

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment variables (`.env.local` [for Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables)).
If you don't have a key, get one from your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys):

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

Use the `AIFormToolkitConfig` to provide the action functions from server package to the client-side.
In Next.js, do that in your [root layout](https:/nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout):

```jsx {8-11}
import { AIFormToolkitConfig } from '@ai-form-toolkit/client';
import { generateGPTFormAutofill, generateGPTFormSchema } from '@ai-form-toolkit/server';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <AIFormToolkitConfig
          generateFormAutofillFn={generateGPTFormAutofill}
          generateFormSchemaFn={generateGPTFormSchema}
        />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
